## Data

The data I am using in this repo is `data/visit_history.csv` 
It is an interesting data set open by a auto company, which has recorded customer visit behaviors in 4s shop. 

## Running

There is only one notebook `customer_visit_analysis` which aims to do basic customer analysis based on their visit behavior in 4s shop.
